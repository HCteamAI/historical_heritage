<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_modern_style">Modern style</sc_element></b> - an architectural style that became widespread in Europe in the 1890sâ€”1910s as part of the Art Nouveau trend. Modern architecture is distinguished by the rejection of classical lines and angles in favor of more decorative (non-welded, Neo-Gothic, neo-Russian) lines when using new materials such as metal, concrete, reinforced concrete (Church of the Saviour of the Miraculous Image in Klyazma, Bridge of Dragons) and glass (Glass Pavilion).
