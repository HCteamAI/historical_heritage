The term came into use at the end of the XVIII century, during the period of neoclassicism, so at first it was used with a negative connotation in the meaning of "pretentious, whimsical, distorted". In the creations of this architecture, straight lines and flat surfaces almost disappear, or at least are masked by figured trim.
